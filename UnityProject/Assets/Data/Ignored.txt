Other:Hey? you're still there?
Me:yes, sorry, what were you saying?

Other:hello...?
Me:Yeah, sorry, job called.
Other:I see where your priorities are...
Me:Oh stop it with the guilt trip, haha

Other:Nice to be ignored...
Me:Sorry, there was a new trend I HAD to comment on.
Other:Wasn't that your last excuse?
Me:Online life is going fast, gotta keep up!
Other:It would be nice if you kept up with your family too!
Me:Fine! I'll come to the next family dinner...
